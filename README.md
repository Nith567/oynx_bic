I wantedly added api key's instead of using env to test this project.Here based on the media file he uploads the data we give number of VC's with oynx sdk.
In the demo the bundler url isn't working before 4-5 hours ago it worked fine for me(I know it's truly sucks while doing demo, sorry for that!!).I didn't connected with social lens dapp due to my sem exams but in future i will.Thank you ....
